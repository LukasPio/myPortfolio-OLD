(This project is old, I've learned a lot since I developed it, but I think it's relevant to keep it public because of the effort I had to do it at the time.)

# myPortfolio

I created a minimalist portfolio, in a dark style, using only CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I just need to work on the responsiveness 
aspect and find better projects for the projects section. I would like to share it with you and let you know that I am open to any feedback.
